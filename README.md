We'll be using Eclipse Oxygen, Java 1.8 and Spring Boot 1.5.12 to create the "events" project we have once created using pure java and JAX-RS.
The code is not complete, but it can be used as a starting point for your projects.
<p>
<b>ASSUMPTION</b>: you have your MySQL server up and it has the relevant tables
</p>
Download the project into your workspace and run the application.
Now go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/events.html">http://localhost:8080/events.html</a>
